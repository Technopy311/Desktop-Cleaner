## Disclaimer
This script has been made with python3 (python 3.8)

### Description
This script was made
for checking a certain folder, in my case,
i use my pc Download's folder because there is
always much garbage, and then, it lists
the contains of that folder, and compares 
the extension of each file, and if the 
extension of the files is in a certain list
it moves to a designated folder

### Seting up 

For setting up the script, you only need to change
a few lines of code, 

**First** you need to modify the lines from 14 to 19.
that is to setup where the files should go.

**Second** you need to modify the lines from 23 to 57
in these lines, are the lists of extensions to compare
with the file's extension.

**And Third** you only need to call the 
Organinzing function and pass a 
parameters the Extension list
and the Destination folder.

***And that's all***
